# Mobile Training

This repository contains various projects and exercises related to mobile development that I've worked on. It includes:

- **Dart**: The basic Dart language exercises to learn the fundamentals before moving on to Flutter.
- **Flutter**: Various exercises and tasks such as random challenges from the internet, Flutter community tasks, and the **42 Mobile Piscine**, which teaches the basics of mobile development.
- **Apps**: Apps I've worked on using my own designs or random designs from platforms like Figma or Behance.
- **Backend**: The backend folder that provides the APIs needed to work with the apps.
